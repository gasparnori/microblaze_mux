2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
